### 1.0 Introduction

The product in development is an Web Application called Weekly Planner, designed to enable the user to maintain any number of ingredients for the meal plan to keep track of the items they may need.  In today's mobile-centric world, we hope to provide the user with a more practical way to maintain meal plans in a clean, simple web app that they can access from their mobile device instead of worrying about the hassle of written lists.

### 2.0 Process Description

(Modified version of a typical, extended software development process.)

#### 1: Requirements analysis
- **Description:** Specifying the functional capabilities needed in the software, including use-cases and specific requirements from the client. 
- **Entrance criteria:** Specifications from the user or client, requirements, and any use-cases that will be critical to the design of the app.
- **Exit criteria:** Produce software requirements documentation (i.e., UML diagrams) and a developing plan surrounding **what** we are building.

#### 2: Design
- **Description:** Developing the components, entities, attributes, and methods that are essential to the client's model of the software and its behavior, and the relationship between all of the above.
- **Entrance criteria:** Specifications from the user or client, and more concrete understandings of the requirements.
- **Exit criteria:** Updated and release final design of css/html files..

#### 3: Implementation
- **Description:** Writing and compiling code for the individual software components.
- **Entrance criteria:** Final versions of design documents and software requirements.
- **Exit criteria:** Working software that meets the requirements specified and clarified in the previous activities.

#### 4: Testing
- **Description:** Repeatedly executing the code in a targeted fashion in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements.
- **Entrance criteria:** A finalized initial implementation of the code.
- **Exit criteria:** Testing documentation that shows all cases tested and their resoluion, an iterated process of fixing any errors and re-testing until the software is clean and properly meets all requirements.

#### 5: Deployment
- **Description:** Releasing the final product to the client for use.
- **Entrance criteria:** Completed, clean, and tested code, updated documentation, and a carefully documented and completed test plan.
- **Exit criteria:** The app is fully usable by the client.
